  <h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
  The purpose of this application is to find locations quickly and to create a route to desired destination. 
  Then route is exported the to GPX file in order to uppload it to GPX navigator. I personally use <a href="http://www.gpsbabel.org/"><i>GPSBabel</i></a>
  to load exported files to my <i>Garmin eTrex Legend HCx</i>, but other programs and devices may work as well.
  Application is based on Google Maps API.
  
  <h2>Concepts and usage</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>Suggested Workflow</strong><br/>
   <p>
   <ol>
   <li>Find location(s) in <i>Location</i> tab.</li>
   <li>Switch to <i>Route</i> tab and define route by creating waypoints on map.</li>
   <li>Export the route to a file by pressing <i>Save</i> button.</li>
   </ol>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>Location search</strong><br/>
   <p>
   You can find nearest known address by clicking on map in <i>Location</i> mode.
   Furthermore, you can search for location by entering address, latitude/longitude coordinates or link from Google Maps site. 
   Every time when location is found, a temporary waypoint is created. If you leave a entry field empty and press 
   search for location, a home location is used.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>Temporary waypoint</strong><br/>
   <p>
   Temporary waypoint (grey marker) is created in order to show exact location. There is the only one temporary waypoint 
   can exist at the time, and it is neither draggable nor part of current route. You can chage such waypoint to a 
   regular one and add it to current route - look at available options in a bubble dialog or just double-click on that waypoint.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>Route</strong><br/>
   <p>
   Route consists of waypoints, listed by creation order. You can reverse the order, or insert/remove additional waypoints 
   in the middle - look at available options in a bubble dialog. Once a route is created, you can save it as a file in GPX format.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>Home Location</strong><br/>
   <p>
   You can define any way point as a home location. This location is saved as a cookie and will be used as default location 
   every time you go to this site or search with empty location.
   </p>
  </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Web browser support</h2>
  Currently, only <i>Firefox</i> is in the list of supported browsers, but in the near future 
  I may add <i>Chrome</i> and <i>Safari</i> to the list.
